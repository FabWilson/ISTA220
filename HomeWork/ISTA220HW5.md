4.How long does a while loop run?
For as long as some condition is true. 

5.What happens if you donâ€™t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
The program keeps running  (infinite loop). 

6.How many parts does a for loop statement have?  3- Initialization, Termination condition, variable update, 
Can you omit any of them? Yes, any part of it
Can you omit all of them? No, must be one 
What happens if you omit all of them? Defaults to true and runs forever.

7.How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
The loop must be a while loop due to it not being evaluated until the end.

8.What does the break statement do?
Used to jump out of switch statement or the body of an iteration statement.

9.What does the continue statement do?
Causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression).
